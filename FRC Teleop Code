//This is the code for the teleoperated period of the match
//It is very simple because it is all in a while loop, you will see
//You have to define your variables outside of the separate classes ie. teleopInit()
//Then there is a class called RobotInit(), here you complete your variables; I will explain
//Outside of the classes to predefine your variables you have to put the variable then what it represents ie. Joystick control;
//Joystick is what the variable defines and control is the variable
//To fully define it in RobotInit() you have to do it like this: control = Joystick(int);
//So variable equals then finish the defining statement
//This allows the robot to initialize(hence the "init") the varables before you even begin to control the bot, this avoids many problems
//Some problems you encounter while doing this involve the robot not properly recognizing variables leading to runtime errors in the
//Console driver station and a bad score at competition

The arcadeDrive is a driving library that allows you to control moving with only one joystick, the opposite of this with two joysticks is tankDrive.
